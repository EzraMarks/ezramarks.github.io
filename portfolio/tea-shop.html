        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Designing The Tea Shop primarily allowed me to explore the capabilities of React for creating an interactive website. The main interactivity is centered around seamless filtering and sorting of items, allowing a user to easily find a tea that suits their needs: filter by tea type (e.g. black or green), format (loose or bagged), or sort the collection by caffeine content. I made use of the CSS Grid Layout in making the website responsive, allowing The Tea Shop to be used on any device, desktop or mobile. I was additionally able to put into practice my knowledge of user interface and user experience design, creating a tool that incorporates many features while remaining easy to use and without visual clutter.</p>
        <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
        <p>The Tea Shop interface draws heavily on core principles of user interface design. Keeping with simplicity, I chose a single green accent color which remains consistent throughout the interface. I use just two typefaces and three different font sizes to maintain a clear visual hierarchy. I also do not shy away from white space, utilizing the empty space to separate the components of the page while avoiding visual clutter. The interface includes many subtle details to increase affordances. For instance, I created custom larger checkboxes which increase the ease of targeting. I also added affordances to indicate that the tea items are clickable, such as increasing the drop shadow on hover and changing the mouse pointer style. Finally, I made the page fully responsive for all screen sizes using CSS Grid.</p>
