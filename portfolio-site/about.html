      <h1>Hi, I'm Ezra.</h1>
      <p>I like to make things.</p>
      <p>I am currently a 2nd year student at Brown University, studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My central focus is software engineering, with an interest in human-computer interaction, user experience, and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>My core passion is and has always been creating, though my medium of choice may change&mdash;from cardboard and hot glue all the way to computer science, and on occasion back to cardboard and hot glue. They are not all that different: beautiful and versatile ways for me to bring new ideas into the world.</p>
      <p>I would love to hear from you by email at <b>ezra_marks@brown.edu</b>, or visit me on the platforms below.</p>
